Phantom Foundry v6 â€” Web Suite (UK-ready)
Generated: 2025-08-24

Quick start (no coding):
1) Create a new GitHub repository named 'phantom-foundry-v6'.
2) Upload the contents of this ZIP into the repo using drag-and-drop in GitHub web UI.
3) Frontend: On Vercel, create a new project from the repo. Vercel auto-detects Next.js. Deploy.
4) Backend: On Render, create a new Python Web Service from the backend/ folder. Choose UK region if available.
5) In Vercel settings set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE to your Render backend URL and redeploy the frontend.
6) Open the Vercel URL and use the app in Demo Mode (draft-only).

Important safety: Draft-only is ON by default. Audit logs are created for each batch. Only enable auto-publish after manual review.
